# Session Progress Log

## Current State

**Last Updated:** 2026-07-15 (Module 0 run end-to-end on real data; feat-004 done)
**Active Feature:** feat-003 - Leakage-Safe Train/Val/Test Splits (not started; deps feat-002 satisfied)

## Status

### What's Done

- [x] feat-001 Environment & Data Download — **DONE**
  - Env imports OK (anndata 0.13.1, mudata 0.3.10, h5py 3.16.0)
  - Aggregate layer downloaded to `data/raw/` (~101 GB): 4 HDF5 + 15 suppl tables + 12 jsonld
  - Cell-level files intentionally excluded (storage-blocked)
- [x] feat-002 Data Inspection & ID Mapping — **DONE**
  - `examples/` inspectors; `src/tcell_pipeline/id_mapping.py`
  - Ran online on real DE: 12311 unique Ensembl (11526 targets / 10282 measured / 9497 both), all HGNC
    resolved, UniProt/Entrez filled via mygene.info
  - One-to-many UniProt DISAMBIGUATED (reviewed-canonical strategy, see Decisions): 33 multi-accession
    genes -> 23 resolved to a confident canonical, 10 genuine multi-product loci flagged
    `uniprot_ambiguous` with all candidates kept in `uniprot_alternatives`
- [x] feat-004 PPI Graph Construction — **DONE**
  - `ppi_graph.py` typed-edge harmonizer + `complex_membership.py` CORUM bipartite membership
  - All 5 sources fetched + merged on real data -> `data/graphs/protein_edges.parquet`:
    **7,980,907 edges** (bioplex 118162, huri 52256, biogrid 1218142, string 13715404, corum 77696)
  - `complex_membership.parquet`: 18,932 memberships / 5,628 complexes (CORUM 5.3)
  - `ppi_degree_*` computed from the graph into perturbation_condition

- [x] **Module 0 data pipeline** (`src/tcell_pipeline/`, 9 modules + `run_module0.py`) ran end-to-end on
  real data. Derived marts written under `data/intermediate/`, `data/graphs/`, `data/manifests/`
  (all gitignored): id_mapping, DE layers (zscore/log_fc sparse NPZ; neglog10_p_value/neglog10_adj_p_value/
  baseMean/lfcSE dense NPY), de_obs/de_var, protein_edges, complex_membership, perturbation_condition
  (33983 rows; 187 without UniProt; 32425/33983 with a control baseline), control baseline + donor
  profiles, feature_availability.yaml (**q_pre=43 / q_post=13 / metadata=2, leakage fence disjoint**).
- [x] **This session's fixes** (commits e453964..eab027e):
  - UniProt disambiguation via reviewed-canonical strategy (`choose_uniprot`); `uniprot_ambiguous` flags
    only equal-evidence ties (10 loci: CDKN2A p16/p14ARF, GNAS, MOCS2, TMPO...)
  - HuRI download: apex host `interactome-atlas.org` (cert invalid for the `www.` subdomain)
  - CORUM download: migrated to CORUM 5.3 fastapi endpoint (old `coreComplexes.txt.zip` path gone);
    handles new `subunits_gene_name` schema; per-source TLS-verify skip for the broken helmholtz cert chain
  - feature_availability: `KNOWN_METADATA_COLS` allowlist so the leakage-fence REVIEW warning fires only
    on genuinely-unexpected metadata (row_index/mapping_status no longer cry wolf)
  - `mygene` added to requirements.txt
- [x] 23 pytest tests in `src/tests/` (synthetic fixtures; added test_control_profiles.py,
  test_complex_membership.py); `init.sh` green (compileall + pytest)

### What's In Progress

- (none — feat-004 closed this session)

### What's Next

1. feat-003 Leakage-Safe Train/Val/Test Splits — gene-family / protein-complex / graph-neighborhood
   blocking, hash + freeze split files. Inputs now all present: id_mapping, protein_edges,
   complex_membership, perturbation_condition.
2. Optional: near-null-signal check on development data before freezing H1 (2026-07-14 finding).

## Blockers / Risks

- [ ] `data/raw` ~101 GB near the 105 GiB soft cap; derived marts now also on disk (protein_edges ~35 MB,
  DE layers, control profiles) — watch disk before feat-005 program bases land
- [ ] **Near-null-signal regime (2026-07-14 finding):** this CD4+ screen may be near-null-signal (models
  barely beat the mean). Confirm a detectable above-mean signal before freezing H1; a rigorous negative
  benchmark is a valid outcome.
- [x] RESOLVED: HuRI + CORUM downloads (both source URLs migrated this session)
- [x] RESOLVED: id_mapping UniProt/Entrez (online mygene pass done; only 6 no-hit genes remain, HGNC-resolved)

## Decisions Made

- **UniProt disambiguation**: pick the gene's reviewed human canonical (UniProt REST gene_exact+reviewed)
  by annotation-score then lexical; flag only equal-evidence ties; keep the gene as the perturbation unit
  (CRISPRi knocks down the whole locus) — no forced single-protein pick, alternatives preserved
- **CORUM host**: broken TLS chain (certifi also fails) -> per-source verify skip for `corum` only
- Data scope: aggregate layer only; cell-level (~1.6 TiB) excluded
- Donor key = physical CE codes; independent NTC controls come from pseudobulk (DE has none)
- Distributional metrics: do not use Wasserstein/Energy distance as a sole headline metric
- Stable-Shift (feat-010): first-party code unconfirmed; plan a row-compatible reimplementation

## Files Modified This Session

- `src/tcell_pipeline/id_mapping.py` — reviewed-canonical UniProt disambiguation
- `src/tcell_pipeline/ppi_graph.py` — HuRI apex URL, CORUM 5.3 fastapi URL + `_corum_gene_col` + TLS skip
- `src/tcell_pipeline/complex_membership.py` — new CORUM schema via shared `_corum_gene_col`
- `src/tcell_pipeline/feature_availability.py`, `config.py` — `KNOWN_METADATA_COLS` allowlist
- `src/tests/` — test_complex_membership.py (NEW), test_id_mapping / test_feature_availability cases (23 total)
- `requirements.txt` — `mygene`
- `feature_list.json` — feat-004 -> done; feat-002 evidence updated
- `progress.md`, `session-handoff.md` — state sync

Derived artifacts written to `data/intermediate/`, `data/graphs/`, `data/manifests/` (all gitignored).

## Notes for Next Session

- `examples/` scripts double as data-understanding docs
- Read the experiment plan report for detailed feature specs (2026-07-14 literature refresh)
- Before feat-011 screening / freezing H1, run the near-null-signal check
- Module 0 marts are on disk but gitignored; rerun `python src/tcell_pipeline/run_module0.py` to regenerate
